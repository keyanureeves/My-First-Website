    <h1>My Blockchain Journey So Far</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>How it all Started</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into the world of blockchain began in early 2024 when I first
          heard about Bitcoin from a friend. Intrigued by the concept of
          decentralized currency, I started researching more about blockchain
          technology and its potential applications beyond just cryptocurrencies. At
          the time, I had no clear roadmap for learning but was eager to dive and
          explore this new frontier. At the time, I was coming from a background in
          Quantity Surveying , dealing with numbers, cost estimates, and reak-world
          assets. My work was practical and grounded in reality but I kept feeling
          that something was missing - especially when I looked at it from the
          perspective of how slow , opaque and inefficient systems around ownership,
          payments, and trust were in and around Real Estate or just in general.

      <h2>The inquiry Phase</h2>

        <p>
          To be really honest, my initial thoughts on blockchain were a mix of
          excitement and skepticism. While I was fascinated by the idea of a
          decentralized system that could potentially disrupt traditional financial
          institutions, I was also wary of the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies. I
          questioned whether blockchain technology could truly deliver on its
          promises of transparency, security, and efficiency. However, my curiosity
          pushed me to delve deeper into understanding how blockchain works, its
          underlying principles, and the various use cases being explored across
          different industries.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the time, blockchain felt like noise. Everyone seemed to be talking
          about crypto prices, NFTs, and how crypto is the next big thing. But I
          wanted to understand the technology itself and its real-world
          applications. I started by reading articles, watching videos, and joining
          online forums to learn from others who were also interested in blockchain.
          I quickly realized that there was a lot of misinformation and hype
          surrounding the topic, which made it challenging to separate fact from
          fiction. So I started asking questions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>What is blockchain beyond speculation?</li>
          <li>Why does decentralisation matter?</li>
          <li>How do smart contacts solve the problem of trust with code?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Most of the time early learning was research heavy. I spent hours reading
          whitepapers, watching explainer videos, and participating in online
          communities on discord. I also took some online courses to get a more
          structured understanding of blockchain technology. It was a steep learning
          curve, but I was determined to grasp the fundamentals. The concepts were
          excting but overwhelming - wallets, gas fees, networks, tokens, Web2 vs
          Web3 - it felt like learning a new language while still figuring out the
          alphabet.At this stage I was still a consumer and not a builder
        </p>

       <h2>Research Without Direction(and Why It wasn't enough)</h2>

        <p>
          For a while I was stuck in research mode, consuming content without a
          clear direction. I would jump from one topic to another, trying to
          understand everything at once. While this helped me build a foundational
          knowledge of blockchain, I realized that I needed to start applying what I
          had learned in order to truly grasp the concepts. Reading about smart
          contracts and decentralized applications was one thing, but building them
          was a whole different challenge. I understood ideas in theory, but nothing
          realy clicked. I could explain smart conrtacts , but I couldn't write one.
          That's when I realiszed something important: until I started building
          small projects, I wasn't truly learning and blockchain isn't a space you
          understand by reading alone - it's a space you understand by building,
          breaking things, and fixing them.
        </p>

        <h2>The Shift: From Observer to Builder</h2>

        <p>
          The real shift happened when I decided to learn how smart contracts
          actually work. At that point in time I had no idea where to start but I
          knew that I neede to get my hands dirty. So I called my friend , Ted and
          Sam who are both software engineers and they directed me to Web3 Clubs
          Kenya. Even though I had no computer science background, I knew I wanted
          to build something. So I joined there Solidity Learning Cohort and started
          learning the basics of smart contract development. The first few weeks
          were tough - I struggled to understand the syntax and logic behind writing
          smart contracts. But with persistence and practice, I gradually started to
          get the hang of it. I don't remember when but something flipped.
          Blockchchain stopped being abstract and become tangible. Like music. You
          don't just listen to music, you play an instrument. You don't just read
          about blockchain, you build on it.

       <h2>Finding Direction Through Projects</h2>

        <p>
          Instead of trying to learn everything at once, I started focusing on
          specific projects that interested me. I built simple smart contracts,
          experimented with decentralized applications, and even participated in
          hackathons. Each project taught me something new and helped me solidify my
          understanding of blockchain technology. I also joined online communities
          and forums where I could connect with other blockchain enthusiasts and
          developers. These interactions provided valuable insights and feedback
          that helped me improve my skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked through Solidity fundamentals and applied them to real use cases:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>A charity donation platform to understand transparency and trust</li>
          <li>An NFT marketplace to learn minting, ownership, and transfers</li>
          <li>
            Exploring tokenized real estate concepts, influenced by my background in
            construction and property
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is where my learning accelerated. By building projects, I was able to
          see how the concepts I had learned in theory applied in practice. It also
          helped me identify areas where I needed to improve my skills and
          knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wasn't just learning syntax anymore. I was learning why the code
          mattered.
        </p>

      <h2>Expanding the Stack: Frontend & Full Systems Thinking</h2>

        <p>
          As I became more comfortable with smart contract development, I realized
          that understanding the full stack of blockchain applications was crucial.
          I started learning about frontend development starting wit HTML and CSS
          basic then later using frameworks like React and how to connect smart
          contracts to user interfaces using libraries like Web3.js, Ethers.js and
          Wagmi etc. This holistic approach allowed me to see how all the pieces fit
          together in a decentralized application.
        </p>

        <p>
          This phase taught me something crucial: Web3 is not just about contracts -
          it's about complete systems. Smart contracts, frontend interfaces, backend
          services, and user experience all need to work together seamlessly to
          create effective decentralized applications. Understanding this
          interconnectedness has been key to my growth as a blockchain developer.
        </p>

        <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>

        <p>
          Today, my approach to blockchainis is very difficult from when I started.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've moved from being a passive consumer of information to an active
          builder and problem solver. I now approach blockchain with a more critical
          eye, focusing on practical applications and real-world impact rather than
          just theoretical concepts. My journey has been filled with challenges and
          setbacks, but each obstacle has been an opportunity to learn and grow. I'm
          excited about the future of blockchain technology and the potential it
          holds to transform industries and empower individuals.
        </p>


        <p>
          I work with:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Solidity for contract development</li>
          <li>JavaScript and TypeScript for frontend and backend development</li>
          <li>React for building user interfaces</li>
          <li>Ethers.js and Web3.js for interacting with blockchain networks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>An achievement that I am proud of is participating in Devpost's Build Resilient Apps with Polkadot Cloud and was one of the winners. That was proof enough that I can compete. I needed no more validation. I just need to keep building and learning. </p>
